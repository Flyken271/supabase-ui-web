# Introduction

## An open-source UI component library inspired by Tailwind and AntDesign.

Supabase UI is a high level UI component library with a focus on creating beutiful apps quickly and efficiently.
We designed Supabase UI while using Tailwind CSS utlity classes to handle layouts and grids.

## Vision

We have compiled repeatable UI patterns into components that we see in everyday apps that we need to use repeatably.

We are also implementing Supabase specific components, so that that Supabase can be used quickly and interacted with easily.

## Key Features

### Tailwind friendly

We have tried to compile a group of aesthetically pleasing components with design inspiration from existing UI libraries and also Tailwind UI examples.

We also try to allow tailwind css classes be used where nessasary, for example with animations and we strongly encourage you to use a tailwind config with Supabase UI when we release our themeing support.

### Open source

The whole library is open source, and we are trying to integrate other open source projects into this library if we can.

Examples of using open source libraries could be integrating an array of Icon libraries, as well as using libraries to handle design patterns like context menus, toast messages and interactive tables.

### Developer experience

We have tried to keep the library fully typed where possible, it is an ongoing effort.

Part of the focus has also been on making sure components can be controlled and uncontrolled.
We are going to some effort in making sure that you don't need to keep local states for unessaary things but rather provide callbacks for useful interactions or state changes.
This is also an ongoing effort as some components are half implemented or perhaps not tested yet.

### WAI ARIA

We are trying to make our components adhere to the [WAI-ARIA design patterns](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2).
We would like to see Supabase UI handle aria and role attributes, focus management and also keyboard navigation.
